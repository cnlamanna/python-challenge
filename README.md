Challenge:
PyBank:  You are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
The total number of months included in the dataset
The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

PyPoll: You are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
The total number of votes cast
A complete list of candidates who received votes
The percentage of votes each candidate won
The total number of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote

PyPoll code is full of commented-out sections, because while I was able to get the right format of everything and the right candidate names it was not producing the right percentages and tallies. after playing around with it for a while, I realized based on the count, that it was duplicating the math somewhere, so even though it took me forever, and A LOT  of trial and error, I condensed the candidate name finder and counter together, and it produced the right numbers finally.
I kept the commented-out sections because they still worked in their own way and might be worth looking back on later on
