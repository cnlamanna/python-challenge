# python-challenge
# 5/20, finally finished the coding of the budget_data.csv, it provides the correct answers in the terminal
# there was probably an easier way to write out the code than constantly repeating the "with open" statement, but it made sense to me and it allowed me to better break apart the different sections of the code
# if I have extra time, I will see about making the exported analysis file look better. it produces the desired results, but I would like it if I could space the answers out like the terminal does, but I need to move on to PyPoll now, and will see about returning to this later.
# the final code of pybank is pushed to my github repo
FINALLY  finished PyPoll
was able to figure out how to line break in the export file, it is (\n) unlike the terminal you have to manually line break
also, I went back and noticed I didn't have dollar signs in pybank so i added those and re-pushed
PyPoll code is full of commented out sections, becuase while i was able to get the right format of everything and the right candidate names it was not producing the right percentages and tally's. after playing around with it for a while, i realized based on the count, it was duplicating the math somewhere, so even though it took me forever, and A LOT  of trial and error, I condensed the candidate name finder and counter together, and it produced the right numbers finally.
i kept the commented out sections, because they still worked in there own way and might be worth looking back on later on
