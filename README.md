# python-challenge
# 5/20, finally finished the coding of the budget_data.csv, it provides the correct answers in the terminal
# there was probably an easier way to write out the code than constantly repeating the "with open" statement, but it made sense to me and it allowed me to better break apart the different sections of the code
# if I have extra time, I will see about making the exported analysis file look better. it produces the desired results, but I would like it if I could space the answers out like the terminal does, but I need to move on to PyPoll now, and will see about returning to this later.
# the final code of pybank is pushed to my github repo
